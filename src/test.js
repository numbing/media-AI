    One month ago, Travel & Leisure reported a source confirmed that Meghan Markle 
    and Prince Harry would be going to Namibia on their honeymoon—something People 
    echoed in its report that the luxury Hoanib Valley Camp was one likely option 
    for the couple. But even if that was the original plan, as soon as it became 
    public and reported widely across outlets, that changed fast. 
    E! reported right after the wedding that Namibia was not the destination. 
    And royal expert Omid Scobie, who was ABC News's royal contributor during 
    the wedding, confirmed that really any destination the press catches wind of is out.`,

        Real Madrid faces Liverpool on Saturday in the UEFA Champions League final in Kiev, Ukraine. 
        Madrid is in the final four the third year in a row, and the fourth time in five years. 
        Liverpool last played in the final in 2007.
        What to Expect in the Champions League Final
        • Goals. Liverpool set a tournament record this season with 46. Their player to watch is Mohamed Salah,
        the Egyptian striker who led the Premier League in scoring and has 44 goals in all competitions. 
        Real Madrid counters with its Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo, the leading scorer in Champions 
        League history (120 goals in 152 appearances).
        
        • Ronaldo scored 15 goals in 12 Champions League games this season. One more on Saturday would
        make him the only player to score in four Champions League finals.
        
        • Real Madrid is looking to extend its record by winning a 13th Champions League title, and to become
        the first team since Bayern Munich (1974-76) to claim three in a row.

        • “We’ll never live this again,” Real Madrid Manager Zinedine Zidane said Friday. “We’ll live other 
        moments but we’ll never have today and tomorrow again. We need to take advantage. If there’s pressure,
        well, that’s life. It makes it better.”
        
        • Liverpool is chasing its sixth trophy, which would move it ahead on Bayern Munich and Barcelona on
        the all-time list. Only Madrid and A.C. Milan, with seven, have more. The Reds’ last visit to the final 
        was in 2007 (a loss to Milan). Their last triumph was in 2005, when Liverpool rallied from a 3-0 halftime 
        deficit to beat Milan on penalties — a game that has become known as the Miracle of Istanbul.
        
        • “This club has it in its DNA to win big things,” Liverpool Manager Jurgen Klopp said Friday. 
        “We are here because we are Liverpool. We cannot try to fight on their level, but tactics in football 
        are there to bring an opponent onto your level.”
